          I read <strong><em>Conversations with Goethe</em></strong> when I was
          finishing up my fine arts training in Barcelona. I felt Goethe's
          words, unsurprisingly, as the truest and clearest I've ever heard
          anybody speak about doing art.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recently had Goethe's advice resurfacing in one of my favorite John
          Lennon songs:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          One day at a time is all we do.<br />One day at a time is good for
          you.<br />-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4Qpk6ZDZPg">

          "My advice to youth is always to treat only small objects," Goethe
          replied, "but does one do what we old people say? Everyone believes
          that he must know it best himself, and in so doing some get lost, and
          some have long to err in this.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          But there is no time to err now, we old men have been for that; and
          what would all our searching and erring have helped us, if you younger
          people wanted to walk the same paths again?
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          We would never get anywhere! We old men are credited with error,
          because we did not find the paths blazed; but he who enters the world
          later on is asked more of him, he should not err and seek again, but
          should make use of the counsel of the old men and proceed straight
          away on the good way. It shall not be enough that steps be taken that
          once lead to the goal, but every step shall be goal and be regarded as
          a step.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          For the time being, as I have said, you always make only small
          objects, always

            >freshly prepare everything that presents itself to you daily, you
            will usually always do something good, and every day will bring you
            joy.
          </strong>
          Give it first into the paperbacks, into the magazines; but never
          submit to foreign demands, but always do it according to your own
          sense.

          I made almost all my best
          <a href="https://markusstrasser.org/about">drawings</a> in an
          afternoon and on a small (A4) canvas. I had many bigger artistic
          projects, but they tended to not get finished. Entropy took its share
          and time and space were my enemies.

          All of my poems are occasional poems, they are inspired by reality and

          We spoke of his 'Journey via Frankfurt and Stuttgart to Switzerland',
          which he has in three booklets and which he wants to send me so that I
          can read the details and make suggestions on how to make a whole out
          of it. "You will see," he said, "everything is only written down as
          the moment was; there is no plan or artistic curve in it, it is like
          pouring out a bucket of water". I was pleased with this parable, which
          seemed to me very suitable to describe something quite aimless.

          The fisherman may succeed, but the hunter may not. But if something in
          the whole is not right, it is defective as a whole, however good
          individual parts may be, and you have not achieved anything perfect.
          But if you simply present the individual games that you are up to
          independently, you will surely do something good.

          want to give a view of things, and it is seldom mature in youth.

          There fact and character are handed down, and the poet has only the
          animation of the whole. In this he also preserves his own fullness,

          One sees," said Goethe, "that the young man has talent; but that he
          learned everything by himself, therefore one should not praise him,

          <br />And further Leonardo da Vinci says: 'If your son has complete
          command of perspective and anatomy, make him a good master. And now,"

        <blockquote>
          "Giving advice is a thing of its own," said Goethe, "and when one has
          seen for a while in the world how the most clever things fail and the
          most absurd often leads to a happy goal, then one probably refrains
          from wanting to give advice to someone.

            him who gives it an insolence.</strong

        <blockquote>
          One should give advice only in things in which one wants to
          participate oneself. If another asks me for good advice,<strong>
            I may well say that I am ready to give it, but only on the condition
            that he will promise not to act upon it.</strong

        <blockquote>
          "Mein Rat an die Jugend is immer nur kleine Gegenstände zu behandeln"
          erwiderte Goethe; »aber tut man denn, was wir Alten sagen? Jeder
          glaubt, er müsse es doch selber am besten wissen, und dabei geht
          mancher verloren, und mancher hat lange daran zu irren.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Es ist aber jetzt keine Zeit mehr zum Irren, dazu sind wir Alten
          gewesen; und was hätte uns alle unser Suchen und Irren geholfen, wenn
          ihr jüngeren Leute wieder dieselbigen Wege laufen wolltet?
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Da kämen wir ja nie weiter! Uns Alten rechnet man den Irrtum zugute,
          weil wir die Wege nicht gebahnt fanden; wer aber später in die Welt
          eintritt, von dem verlangt man mehr, der soll nicht abermals irren und
          suchen, sondern er soll den Rat der Alten nutzen und gleich auf gutem
          Wege fortschreiten. Es soll nicht genügen, daß man Schritte tue, die
          einst zum Ziele führen, sondern jeder Schritt soll Ziel sein und als
          Schritt gelten.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Machen Sie vorderhand, wie gesagt, immer nur kleine Gegenstände, immer
          alles frischweg, was sich Ihnen täglich darbietet, so werden Sie in

            jeder Tag wird Ihnen Freude bringen.
          </strong>
          Geben Sie es zunächst in die Taschenbücher, in die Zeitschriften; aber

          nach Ihrem eigenen Sinn.

          Wir sprachen von seiner ›Reise über Frankfurt und Stuttgart nach der

          kommen. Bei einem gegebenen Stoff hingegen ist alles anders und

          Ich habe dieser Tage einen Brief von Mozart gelesen, wo er einem

          gewöhnlich zwei Dinge statt: entweder ihr habt keine eigene Gedanken,
          und da nehmet ihr fremde; oder wenn ihr eigene Gedanken habt, so wißt
          ihr nicht damit umzugehen.‹ Ist das nicht himmlisch? Und gilt dieses
