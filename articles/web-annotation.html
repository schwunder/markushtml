            ><strong>Edit, August 2020:</strong> I now, a year after writing
            this, think that <strong>general</strong> web annotation is not how
            communal sense making is going to evolve. In contrast to general
            annotation, domain-specific corpus and dataset annotation is a
            different story and evolving rapidly. My prediction of an annotation
            service that has a few million users within the next three years
            (now two) will probably still come true, but I changed my prior of
            hope for the area. My guess why this happens is that truth and
            meaning are less and less found inside one document, so why invest
            in massive annotation efforts if it's better to search outside the
            document for more context? Also, many jobs of annotation, like claim
            verification, flagging and connecting similar ideas, which I have
            started to work on, can and will be substituted by ever higher
            levels of natural language processing (NLP).</em

        <p>
          Last winter, I got fed up with how I do <em>Internet</em>, so I
          <a
            href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lupa-reader/jldgmbdpnaegnmbejnpdokhkmobbonhg?authuser=0"
            >prototyped a browser extension </a
          >that lets you create and view annotations within your social circle
          on any website. After sharing the alpha version with a friend, he
          mentioned <a href="https://hypothes.is/">Hypothesis</a> – a team that
          has been working on the same problem for years and already made strong
          headway towards open source web annotation.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first I was frustrated. <br />I spent many days with the torture of
          modern web development<sup>1</sup>, when many of the problems were
          already solved. It's a niche problem apparently, otherwise I'd have
          discovered a solution before feeling pressured to build one.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment, annotation is mostly used by institutional knowledge
          workers (<em>education, publishing,…</em>). In fact, none of my
          friends in tech or science use annotation for work and nobody does so
          privately. This seems strange given that you can surf the web as
          usual, <strong>AND</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            see other's insights, revisions, reviews, critiques, perspectives
            when you look at some content
          </li>
          <li>
            add value with highlights, reactions, comments without the site
            having to build interfaces for it
          </li>
          <li>
            discover shared interests together with friends or whatever group
          </li>
          <li>
            build a richly interlinked knowledge and social graph while at it
          </li>
          <li>
            research collaboratively on steroids
            <em>(keyword: structured annotation markup)</em>
          </li>
          <li>….</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          True, you could get something similar by stacking a few tools (<em
            >maybe Twitter, Delicious, Evernote…</em
          >), switching between apps, keeping stock of context and references
          and so on…but having those interfaces anchored to the actual
          <em>segment of interest </em>instead<em>, </em

          with <a href="https://schema.org/ClaimReview">typed</a> annotations.

          At least that’s what I thought when I started working on it. My
          question then became:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          If it’s so awesome, why isn't it <em>more</em> common?
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          A shallow dive into the <strong>semantic web</strong> rabbit hole,
          promptly surfaced a
          <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f86L7vgHUW9wSLNNSunhjmtxtg6KlCOVpHGKbqUzW-Y/edit#gid=0"
            >graveyard</a
          >
          of failed attempts at web annotation. I'll pick two as example: Google
          SideWiki and (Rap)Genius.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>SideWiki</em> got cancelled in 2011. I couldn’t find out why
            exactly<sup>2</sup>. Google seemed to have all ingredients to win
            big.
          </li>
          <li>
            (Rap)<em>Genius</em>, after getting funded by a16z six years back,
            wanted to annotate more than just song lyrics, but didn’t. They
            still pay lip service to the idea and have portfolio cases where it
            was used, but the project seems to be a silent failure (<em
              >can’t even download a browser extension at this point</em
            >). I guess many users are cautious to silo their content inside
            another VC-funded media company.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_annotation">many more</a>,
          some still active. Amongst them <em>Hypothesis</em> surfaces as most
          reliable. Its open source funding structure makes it less prone to
          surveillance capitalism, sociopath executives, the Chinese military or
          other yet-to-discover corporate BS. You own your data, full stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I overcame the bias I had for my own project, I’ve grown to like
          <em>Hypothesis </em>and embedded it site-wide here. The UI and social
          features are underdeveloped, but that’s fixable. I hope they succeed
          also beyond institutions.

          It wouldn’t make sense to get VC funding and develop a competitor that
          then has to silo data for competitive advantage and network effects.
          I’ve had a taste of that and it’s not healthy for science, society or
          the web. I’d rather build a new generation of apps on top of this
          emerging, open ecosystem.

          The optimist in me predicts an uprise of those meta-applications in
          the next three years, with one of them having a few million users. The
          pessimist still wants a compelling reason why annotation did not take
          off with knowledge workers so far...the tech was there over a decade
          ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dreams about a semantic web with intelligent agents, rich context,
          provenance tracing, lateral search […] have been around for 30 years,
          but are persistently not happening. Currently, we still copy
          information mostly by value, not reference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Referencing entire websites is not granular enough to reuse, test,
          verify and improve on an idea along a single chain of work and
          revision. Most entities don’t have a wikipedia page.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel we’re at a point in this giant <em>internet project</em> where
          many among us, especially developers, are throwing up (<em
            >their hands in anger)</em
          >
          and shout: “<em>Refactor</em>!".
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting annotation right is a fundamental piece for better knowledge
          exchange. To review, iterate, comment, tag, contextualize, version and
          <a href="https://markusstrasser.org/future-search-query">search</a>
          our ideas exactly where they live is how we build tested knowledge
          that gets richer and more meaningful over time. Fingers crossed🤞.
