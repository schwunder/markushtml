          Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was the greatest literary genius Germany
          has ever produced. His first of many masterpieces,
          <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther, </em>made him a celebrity throughout
          Europe at age 25. He remained a dominant figure in European society
          until his death in 1832, at age 82.

          It is pointless to translate Goethe's plays, poems and ballads into
          English, therefore most of his work remains out of western mainstream.
        </p>
        <p>
          Johann Peter Eckermann, a young poet, had become his
          <em>assistant</em> and mentee during the last years of Goethe's life.
          Luckily, he had the good sense to take notes, which were published
          after Goethe died as
          <em>Conversations with Goethe (Gespräche mit Goethe)</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I first read these conversations during my time in Barcelona where I
          was training as fine artist. It was the right time in my life to hear
          Goethe talk shop.

          Almost everything Goethe says carries a profound insight that comes
          from a lifetime of love, loss, exploration, virtuosity and, unique to
          him, being a polymath and Europe's all-time greatest poet. His words
          resonated deep within me and changed me and my approach to art.
        </p>
        <p>
          I agree with Eckermann: "...<em
            >I found the human heart in all its desire, happiness and suffering
            I found a German nature like the present bright day</em
          >"

          I share my notes here, because nobody I know, including Germans, read
          the book and I felt more people should know that it exists.

          All young poets in Germany should know it, it could help them. He

          in comfort.
          <strong>"Take care," he said, "of a great work.</strong> That is what

          to reject all such figures that did not quite fit my intention. For
