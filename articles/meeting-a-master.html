          Johann Peter Eckermann, a young poet, had become Johann Wolfgang von
          Goethe's <em>assistant</em> and mentee during the last years of
          Goethe's life. He wrote down their conversations, which were published
          after Goethe died as
          <em>Conversations with Goethe (Gespräche mit Goethe)</em>.

          The way Eckermann describes meeting and living with Goethe deserve its
          own place. I made this that place.

          [...] It was at this time that I first heard the name Goethe and first
          obtained a volume of his poems. I read his songs, and read them over
          and over again, enjoying a happiness that no words can describe. It
          was as if I was only beginning to wake up and reach the actual
          consciousness; it seemed to me as if my own inner being, hitherto
          unknown to me, was reflected back to me in these songs.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Nor did I find anywhere anything strange or learned, for which my mere
          human thinking and feeling would not have been sufficient, nowhere in
          the names of foreign and obsolete deities, which I couldn't relate to;
          much more I found the human heart in all its desire, happiness and
          suffering, I found a German nature like the present bright day, a pure
          reality in the light of mild transfiguration.

          Cotta.

          The interior of the house made a very pleasant impression on me;
          without being glossy, everything was highly noble and simple; also,
          various casts of antique statues standing on the stairs pointed to
          Goethe's special inclination towards the fine arts and Greek
          antiquity. I saw various women, which were busily going to and fro
          downstairs in the house

          recommends itself. He then praised the clarity of the presentation and
          the flow of thoughts, and that everything rested on a good foundation
          and was well thought out. "I want to transport it quickly," he added;
          "today I am still writing to Cotta with the riding mail, and tomorrow
          I will send the package by riding mail. I thanked him with words and

          wrinkles, and every wrinkle full of expression. And in all this, such
          uprightness and firmness, and such peace and greatness! He spoke
          slowly and comfortably, as one might think of an aged monarch.

          I am also personally associated with very excellent men whose
          acquaintance you will gradually make and whose company will be highly

          It might have been about four o'clock in the morning; it was an
          overcast sky and the first signs of dusk. Goethe lit a light and went
          with it near the window to a table. He put the light on a white sheet
          of paper and placed a stick on it, so that the light of the
          candlelight from the stick cast a shadow after the light of the day.

          The beginning of dusk finally came, and I told Goethe that it was now

          another phenomenon through which the law is to become apparent to you.
          You are close to it, and further in this direction there is no way to
          go. But if you have understood the new law, you have been introduced

          immediately.

        <blockquote>
          I had my joy with the phenomenon. "Yes," said Goethe, "that is what is
          great about nature, that it is so simple and that it always repeats
          its greatest phenomena in small things. The same law that makes the
          sky blue can also be seen in the lower part of a burning candle, in
          the burning spirit and in the illuminated smoke rising from a village
          behind which lies a dark mountain range.

        <blockquote>
          "But how do Newton's students explain this most simple phenomenon?" I

          stupid, and you wouldn't believe what harm it does to a good head to
          deal with something stupid. Don't worry about the Newtonians at all,
          let the pure teaching be enough for you, and you will do well".

          significantly to the advancement of science, but because of the many
          pleasant connections that I maintain. The occupation with nature is
          the most innocent. From an aesthetic point of view, no connection or

          [...] Das Innere des Hauses machte auf mich einen sehr angenehmen
          Eindruck; ohne glänzend zu sein, war alles höchst edel und einfach;
          auch deuteten verschiedene an der Treppe stehende Abgüsse antiker
          Statuen auf Goethes besondere Neigung zur bildenden Kunst und dem
          griechischen Altertum. Ich sah verschiedene Frauenzimmer, die unten im

          Durch die offene Tür gegenüber blickte man sodann in ein ferneres
          Zimmer, gleichfalls mit Gemälden verziert, durch welches der Bediente
          gegangen war mich zu melden. Es währte nicht lange.. so kam Goethe, in

          »Ich komme eben von Ihnen her,« sagte er; »ich habe den ganzen Morgen
          in Ihrer Schrift gelesen; sie bedarf keiner Empfehlung, sie empfiehlt
          sich selber.« Er lobte darauf die Klarheit der Darstellung und den
          Fluß der Gedanken, und daß alles auf gutem Fundament ruhe und wohl
          durchdacht sei. »Ich will es schnell befördern,« fügte er hinzu;
          »heute noch schreibe ich an Cotta mit der reitenden Post, und morgen
          schicke ich das Paket mit der fahrenden nach.« Ich dankte ihm dafür
          mit Worten und Blicken.

          Ich drückte seine Kniee, ich vergaß das Reden über seinem Anblick, ich
          konnte mich an ihm nicht satt sehen. Das Gesicht so kräftig und braun
          und voller Falten, und jede Falte voller Ausdruck. Und in allem solche
          Biederkeit und Festigkeit, und solche Ruhe und Größe! Er sprach
          langsam und bequem, so wie man sich wohl einen bejahrten Monarchen
          denkt.

          haben. Es ist in Weimar noch viel Gutes beisammen, und Sie werden nach
          und nach in den höhren Kreisen eine Gesellschaft finden, die den

          verschiedene angesehene Namen und bezeichnete mit wenigen Worten die

          Ich fühle mich nun durch Goethes Worte um ein paar Jahre klüger und
          fortgerückt und weiß in meiner tiefsten Seele das Glück zu erkennen,
          was es sagen will, wenn man einmal mit einem rechten Meister
          zusammentrifft. Der Vorteil ist gar nicht zu berechnen. Was werde ich
          nun diesen Winter nicht noch bei ihm lernen, und was werde ich nicht
          durch den bloßen Umgang mit ihm gewinnen, auch in Stunden, wenn er
          eben nicht grade etwas Bedeutendes spricht! – Seine Person, seine
          bloße Nähe scheint mir bildend zu sein, selbst wenn er kein Wort
          sagte.

        <p><strong>Goethe teaches Eckerman about Color and Light</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
          Es mochte etwa vier Uhr sein; es war ein bedeckter Himmel und im
          ersten Anfangen der Dämmerung. Goethe zündete ein Licht an und ging
          damit in die Nähe des Fensters zu einem Tische. Er setzte das Licht
          auf einen weißen Bogen Papier und stellte ein Stäbchen darauf, so daß
          der Schein des Kerzenlichtes vom Stäbchen aus einen Schatten warf nach
          dem Lichte des Tages zu. »Nun,« sagte Goethe, »was sagen Sie zu diesem
          Schatten?« – »Der Schatten ist blau«, antwortete ich. – »Da hätten Sie
          also das Blaue wieder,« sagte Goethe; »aber auf dieser andern Seite
          des Stäbchens nach der Kerze zu, was sehen Sie da – »Auch einen
          Schatten.« – »Aber von welcher Farbe?« »Der Schatten ist ein rötliches
          Gelb,« antwortete ich; »doch wie entsteht dieses doppelte Phänomen?« –
          »Das ist nun Ihre Sache,« sagte Goethe; »sehen Sie zu, daß Sie es
          herausbringen. Zu finden ist es, aber es ist schwer. Sehen Sie nicht
          früher in meiner ›Farbenlehre‹ nach, als bis Sie die Hoffnung
          aufgegeben haben, es selber herauszubringen.«
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [...] »Es ist mir sehr lieb,« sagte er, »daß Ihnen dieses Phänomen
          aufgegangen ist, ohne es aus meiner ›Farbenlehre‹ zu kennen; denn nun
          haben Sie es begriffen und können sagen, daß Sie es besitzen. Auch
          haben Sie dadurch einen Standpunkt gefaßt, von welchem aus Sie zu den
          übrigen Phänomenen weitergehen werden. Ich will Ihnen jetzt sogleich
          ein neues zeigen.«
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Der Anfang der Abenddämmerung trat endlich ein, und ich sagte Goethe,
          daß es jetzt Zeit sei. Er zündete die Wachskerze an und gab mir ein
          Blatt weißes Papier und ein Stäbchen. »Nun experimentieren und
          dozieren Sie!«
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [... after a while ...] »Nun so helfen Sie mir«, sagte ich, »und lösen
          Sie mir das Rätsel, denn ich bin nun im höchsten Grade ungeduldig.« –
          »Sie sollen es erfahren,« sagte Goethe, »aber nicht heute und nicht
          auf diesem Wege. Ich will Ihnen nächstens ein anderes Phänomen zeigen,
          durch welches Ihnen das Gesetz augenscheinlich werden soll. Sie sind
          nahe heran, und weiter ist in dieser Richtung nicht zu gelangen. Haben
          Sie aber das neue Gesetz begriffen, so sind Sie in eine ganz andere
          Region eingeführt und über sehr vieles hinaus. Kommen Sie einmal am
          Mittage bei heiterem Himmel ein Stündchen früher zu Tisch, so will ich
          Ihnen ein deutlicher Phänomen zeigen, durch welches Sie dasselbe
          Gesetz, welches diesem zum Grunde liegt, sogleich begreifen sollen. Es
          ist mir sehr lieb,« fuhr er fort, »daß Sie für die Farbe dieses
          Interesse haben; es wird Ihnen eine Quelle von unbeschreiblichen
          Freuden werden.«

          »Mit meinen naturwissenschaftlichen Heften«, sagte Goethe vor einiger
          Zeit, »gehe ich auch langsam fort. Nicht weil ich glaube, die
          Wissenschaft noch jetzt bedeutend fördern zu können, sondern der
          vielen angenehmen Verbindungen wegen, die ich dadurch unterhalte. Die
          Beschäftigung mit der Natur ist die unschuldigste. In ästhetischer
          Hinsicht ist jetzt an gar keine Verbindung und Korrespondenz zu
          denken. Da wollen sie wissen, welche Stadt am Rhein bei meinem
          ›Hermann und Dorothea‹ gemeint sei! – Als ob es nicht besser wäre,
          sich jede beliebige zu denken! – Man will Wahrheit, man will
          Wirklichkeit und verdirbt dadurch die Poesie.«

          Ich hatte meine Freude an dem Phänomen. »Ja,« sagte Goethe, »das ist
          eben das Große bei der Natur, daß sie so einfach ist und daß sie ihre
          größten Erscheinungen immer im Kleinen wiederholt. Dasselbe Gesetz,
          wodurch der Himmel blau ist, sieht man ebenfalls an dem untern Teil
          einer brennenden Kerze, am brennenden Spiritus sowie an dem
          erleuchteten Rauch, der von einem Dorfe aufsteigt, hinter welchem ein
          dunkles Gebirge liegt.«

          »Aber wie erklären die Schüler von Newton dieses höchst einfache
          Phänomen?« fragte ich. »Das müssen Sie gar nicht wissen«, antwortete
          Goethe. »Es ist gar zu dumm, und man glaubt nicht, welchen Schaden es
          einem guten Kopfe tut, wenn er sich mit etwas Dummen befaßt. Bekümmern
          Sie sich gar nicht um die Newtonianer, lassen Sie sich die reine Lehre
          genügen, und Sie werden sich gut dabei stehen.«

          Haben doch auch die Mathematiker nicht die Metamorphose der Pflanze

          Mathematiker haben es müssen gelten lassen. Um die Phänomene der
          Farbenlehre zu begreifen, gehört weiter nichts als ein reines
          Anschauen und ein gesunder Kopf; allein beides ist freilich seltener,

          Ich hatte das Verlangen nach einer Locke von seinen Haaren, doch die
          Ehrfurcht verhinderte mich, sie ihm abzuschneiden. Der Körper lag
          nackend in ein weißes Bettuch gehüllet, große Eisstücke hatte man in
          einiger Nähe umhergestellt, um ihn frisch zu erhalten so lange als
          möglich. Friedrich schlug das Tuch auseinander, und ich erstaunte über
          die göttliche Pracht dieser Glieder. Die Brust überaus mächtig, breit
          und gewölbt; Arme und Schenkel voll und sanft muskulös, die Füße
          zierlich und von der reinsten Form, und nirgends am ganzen Körper eine
          Spur von Fettigkeit oder Abmagerung und Verfall.

          Ein vollkommener Mensch lag in großer Schönheit vor mir, und das
          Entzücken, das ich darüber empfand, ließ mich auf Augenblicke
          vergessen, daß der unsterbliche Geist eine solche Hülle verlassen. Ich
          legte meine Hand auf sein Herz – es war überall eine tiefe Stille –
          und ich wendete mich abwärts, um meinen verhaltenen Tränen freien Lauf
          zu lassen.
