          Almost all of (knowledge) work is happening inside a browser
          and<strong> </strong>most apps are becoming web apps <sup>1</sup>.
          Operating system functions are largely off-shored to browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Browser Extensions have access and context to the interactions in the
          browser. They can access any entity (<em
            >tweets, profiles, articles</em
          >) and event (<em>liking, sending messages, looking at an image)</em>
          that a browser enables. Thatâ€™s most of digital life. Thereâ€™s many
          ideas that only work with having that context (<em
            >eg. claim verification, flagging fake news</em
          >) and so it seems like the next killer application should be a
          browser (extension).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >So, why arenâ€™t we seeing more innovative and ambitious browser
            extensions?</strong
          >
        </p>

          My null hypothesis is usually that people donâ€™t have ideas. Also,
          developing a complex browser extensions, from personal experience, is
          quite annoying:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The development experience is fragmented and hostile. For example.
            state can be scattered between content-, background-, popup scripts,
            storage APIs and a backend.
          </li>
          <li>
            The feedback loop from changing code to seeing changes is much
            slower.
          </li>
          <li>
            I havenâ€™t seen anybody figure out how to actually do software
            testing for browser extensions effectively. Thereâ€™s no end-2-end
            testing and no half-way sane setup for integration testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Without solid automated tests while you develop, it gets
            increasingly masochistic and asinine to add features.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thatâ€™s one reason why the interfaces of browser extensions are
            staying simplistic
          </li>
          <li>
            The Google Playstore controls distribution. Safari and Firefox canâ€™t
            get it together. Pushing a change can take a week until the
            Playstore allows or rejects it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Google likes to make arbitrary changes to the API and security model
          </li>
          <li>
            This makes it fragile to base a business on a browser extension
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thatâ€™s a few pointers for why there isnâ€™t much happening.</p>
        <p>
          I still think browser extensions are massively underrated and
          under-explored.
        </p>

          (1) I havenâ€™t seen good arguments for why this wonâ€™t happen,
          especially with WASM and most of developer tooling focusing on web
          stacks
